# Draw-Guess-TS

My implementation of the draw and guess game.
The server is built using **Typescript** ,socket.io and mongoose.
The app is served with a **React - redux Toolkit** application,
with the server handling logic about users, rooms and games.

The game is available at <https://pic-guess.herokuapp.com/>
